# Data Structures and Algorithms - Lab Programs

This repository contains Python implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms lab assignments.

## Programs Included

### 1. Linear_Search.py
Implements linear search algorithm to find an element in an array.

**How to run:**
```bash
python Linear_Search.py
```
Enter the element you want to search when prompted.

**Time Complexity:**
- Best Case: O(1)
- Worst Case: O(n)

---

### 2. Bubble_Sort.py
Implements bubble sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.

**How to run:**
```bash
python Bubble_Sort.py
```

**Time Complexity:**
- Best Case: O(n)
- Worst Case: O(n²)

---

### 3. Binary_Search.py
Implements binary search algorithm to find an element in a sorted array.

**How to run:**
```bash
python Binary_Search.py
```
Enter the element you want to search when prompted.

**Time Complexity:**
- Best Case: O(1)
- Worst Case: O(log n)

**Note:** Array must be sorted for binary search to work correctly.

### 4. Circular_Linked_List_Deletion.py
Implements a circular linked list with deletion operations at beginning and end.

**Operations:**
- Insert elements
- Delete from beginning
- Delete from end
- Display the list

```bash
python Circular_Linked_List_Deletion.py
```

---

### 5. Circular_Queue.py
Implements a circular queue with enqueue and dequeue operations.

**Operations:**
- Enqueue (insert element)
- Dequeue (remove element)
- Display queue elements
- Check if queue is full or empty

**How to run:**
```bash
